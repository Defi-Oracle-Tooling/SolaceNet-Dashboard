# TODO List for Tatum Virtual Accounts & Hyperledger Besu Integration Project

This TODO file outlines tasks and enhancements based on our integration notes. It is intended to be maintained as a dedicated submodule for our project.

## 1. Setup & Configuration

- [ ] **Environment Variables & Configuration:**
  - Ensure all sensitive data (Tatum API key, Besu RPC URL, master exchange credentials) are managed securely.
  - Verify that `src/config/config.ts` contains correct defaults and production settings.

- [ ] **Submodule Setup:**
  - Add this repository as a submodule in your main project.
  - Example command:
    ```bash
    git submodule add <repository-url> path/to/submodule
    ```

- [ ] **Docker Integration:**
  - Create a `Dockerfile` for containerizing the API.
  - Set up a `docker-compose.yml` to orchestrate the API, Besu node, and other dependencies.

## 2. API & Service Enhancements

- [ ] **Deposit Monitoring (Blockchain Adapter):**
  - Implement logic to avoid duplicate processing of deposits.
  - Add persistence for mapping user deposit addresses and processed transactions.
  - Enhance logging of all detected deposits and confirmation steps.

- [ ] **Withdrawal Processing:**
  - Improve error handling and retry mechanisms in the withdrawal flow.
  - Ensure robust logging for both the off-chain debit (via Tatum API) and on-chain transaction.
  - Implement detailed status tracking for each withdrawal transaction.

- [ ] **Tatum API Integration:**
  - Validate responses from Tatumâ€™s API and handle error cases effectively.
  - Sanitize all inputs and outputs for the Tatum-related endpoints.
  - Consider adding caching for frequent balance requests if necessary.

## 3. Security & Authentication

- [ ] **Authentication Middleware:**
  - Implement API authentication (e.g., JWT, API keys) for protecting endpoints.
  - Add role-based access control to secure administrative functions.

- [ ] **Secrets Management:**
  - Store all sensitive keys and credentials in secure environment variables or a vault solution.
  - Review security best practices for API key and private key management.

## 4. Frontend (SolaceNet Dashboard) Integration

- [ ] **UI Data Integration:**
  - Use React hooks (e.g., with React Query) to fetch updated virtual account balances.
  - Implement real-time updates via WebSockets or polling for improved user experience.

- [ ] **User Interaction Flows:**
  - Enhance the deposit and withdrawal UI flows, incorporating detailed feedback and error messages.
  - Provide comprehensive documentation in the UI regarding processing times and status updates.

## 5. Testing & Documentation

- [ ] **Testing:**
  - Write unit tests for API endpoints, including Tatum and Besu service interactions.
  - Develop integration tests to simulate deposit and withdrawal workflows.
  - Consider end-to-end tests that cover the complete user journey from UI to blockchain.

- [ ] **Documentation:**
  - Update the README.md with clear setup, deployment, and API usage instructions.
  - Document the custom blockchain adapter, Tatum API integration, and the frontend integration process.
  - Maintain detailed logging and error handling documentation.

## 6. Additional Features & Enhancements

- [ ] **Webhook/Event Subscription:**
  - Integrate Tatum and blockchain event webhooks for real-time notifications.
  - Validate and verify incoming webhook data.

- [ ] **Custom Fee Handling:**
  - Implement dynamic fee estimation for on-chain transactions based on current network conditions.
  - Develop a user-configurable fee adjustment mechanism if needed.

- [ ] **Error Reconciliation:**
  - Build an admin interface or script to manually reconcile failed or unprocessed transactions.
  - Implement retry queues or compensation logic for error handling.

- [ ] **Audit Trails:**
  - Enhance logging to include audit trails for all transactions.
  - Ensure logs are stored securely and are accessible for future audits or debugging.
